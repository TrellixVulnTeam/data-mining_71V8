    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "Beyond the the given task definition and data dictionary, there will be no additional client/business communication. Therfore, some assumptions must be made based on *personal*: experience, domain knowledge, and research.\n",

    "**Below is a brief breakdown** of the problem definition and some domain considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "DOMAIN: Cardio-vascular medicine / healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a healthcare dataset it may be \"natural\", anonymised patient data, study data (e.g. clinical trial), or an aggregation of many different datasets.\n",
    "- There is a chance there is \"control\" data (healthy cohorts) within the dataset or, similarly, focus groups that consist of unhealthy cohorts.\n",
    "- Due to the (often) subjective nature of clinical diagnosis (i.e. different doctors with varying levels of experience make the diagnoses), some data may be mislabelled.\n",
    "- Some diagnoses or features may be self-certified or be derived from incorrect patient interpretations (e.g. \"Yes, I have been feeling...\").\n",
    "- Some features might represent the same thing (e.g. an alternative clincal test - both may be conducted or one might replace the other). \n",
    "\n",
    "PROBLEM TYPE: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "INPUTS: Tabulated patient data; (up-to) 1520 records of 11 features\n",

    "OUTPUTS:\n",
    "- Risk\n",
    "- No Risk\n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**More objectively**, domain-specific terminology from the provided data dictionary can be researched further:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atrial Fibrillation\n",
    "    - A form of **arrythmia** (Atrial Fibrillation and other Arrhythmias, 2019).\n",
    "    - Increases risk of stroke (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arrhythmia/)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Asymptomatic Stenosis\n",
    "    - Narrowing of the cartoid artery without recent history of TIA  or ischemic stroke (https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cardiovascular Arrest\n",
    "    - When the heart stops pumping blood - NOT a heart attack (https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/cardiac-arrest).\n",
    "    - Can be caused by arrhythmias (https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-arrest/about-cardiac-arrest).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Transient Ischemic Attack (mini heart attack)\n",
    "    - Risk increased by a-f, asx, diabetes and hypertension (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transient-ischaemic-attack-tia/; https://www.cardiosmart.org/Healthwise/hw22/6606/hw226606).\n",
    "    - Actually a **mini-stroke**, not heart attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diabetes\n",
    "    - Type 2 makes up 90% of cases, but could be type 1 or a mix of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- IHD/CAD (Ischemic Heart Disease/Coronary Artery Disease)\n",
    "    - Narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries (https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/coronary-heart-disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypertension\n",
    "    - i.e high blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrhythmia (erratic heart beat)\n",
    "    - Main types include **a-f**, tachcardia, bradycardia heart block and ventricular fibrilation (may cause cardiac arrest).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPSI (ipsilateral cerebral ischemic lesions)\n",
    "    - Ipsilateral means \"same side\". Based on the context, the side of comparsion is likely the side of the brain that the stroke occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contra (contralateral cerebral ischemic lesions)\n",
    "    - Contralateral means \"opposite side\". Based on the context, the side of comparsion is likely the side of the brain that the stroke occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- (History) Cardiovascular Interventions\n",
    "    - Typically, cardiac invasive treatments e.g. catheterisation. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781444316704)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Patients with an indication of \"a-f\" should also be be recorded as having an arrhythmia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming IPSI and Contra are recorded at the same time in relation to the same stroke or event; and Since IPSI is reffering to the percentage of lesions on the same side and Contra on the opposite side, it would make sense for the 2 values to have sum of 100%\n",
